<P>These are stories of the direct ancestors of our parents;
<Name>William Collins Bevins</Name>,
<Name>Meartia Margaret Heddens</Name>,
<Name>Sheldon Junior Riley</Name>, and
<Name>Dorothy May Trombley</Name>.

In these stories I attempt to go beyond the bare facts of a person's name,
birth, marriage, children, and death.
I try to explore a range of questions that paint a fuller picture of their lives:
&nbsp;
<em>Where did our direct ancestors come from?</em>
<em>What may have compelled them to leave their ancestral homes?</em>
<em>When did they arrive in America?</em>
<em>What routes and modes of transport did they possibly travel?</em>
<em>Where did they stop and live along their way to Minnesota?</em>

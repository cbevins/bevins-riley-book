Dear Steven

Barbara and I are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of your beloved sister Cathy.
There are no words that can relieve the suffering of grief over the loss of a loved one.

You shared with me the story of the last time you were with Cathy
at her home for her 69th birthday celebration,
and what a special occasion it was. What a special memory to hold and cherish.

We believe the weight of grief you feel is a reflection in equal measure
of the life energy and love Cathy brought to you and her family.

You have our deepest sympathies and heartfelt condolences.
Wishing you Peace and Comfort in the knowledge of a life well lived, loved, and shared.

Dear Robbie -

It was with great saddness that Barbara and I learned of the loss of your beloved
sister Cathy.  Steven says Cathy was the center and sun of your family since the
passing of your Mother,
and you had recently shared a memorable birthday celebration with her.

The weight of our grief is a reflection of the weight of our love.
And while neither can be lessed by words,
we share with you our deepest sympathies and heartfelt condolenses.
Wishing you Peace and Comfort...

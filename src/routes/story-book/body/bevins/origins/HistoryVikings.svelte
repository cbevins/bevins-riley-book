Christianity was widely adopted throughout England by 700 AD,
and monasteries proliferated and accumulated immense wealth and power
as they were not taxed and did not split up property for inheritance like
kings and lords.
</P><P>
This did not go unnoticed by the raiding and plundering Danes and Norwegians
we know today as <Bold>Vikings</Bold> (from the Old Norse <Em>vikingr</Em>,
meaning an expedition).
The first major raid in 793 ransacked the Holy Island of Lindisfarne in Northumbria
and is generaly regarded as the beginning of the ‘Viking Age’.
</P><P>
The hit-and-run raids and plundering continued until 850 when, for the first time,
a Viking army overwintered in Mercia. In 865 the <Em>Great Heathen Army</Em>
campaigned for 14 years across most of England in an attempt to subjugate the Anglo
Saxon kingdoms. They were not only a military force, but also a political and
cultural force in the region, appointing puppet kings collecting tribute.
</P><P>
In the winter of 873-874 the Great Army overwintered in Repton, Mercia,
a mere 15 miles northwest of Newbold Verdon.
</P><P>
Eventually, the Vikings established their own kingdom of <Bold>Danelaw</Bold>
in Britain, requiring tribute from the Anglo-Saxons.  This arrangement lasted
for four years until Mercia King Æthelred mounted sufficient deterrence,
after which many of the Viking raiders settled into the English countryside
while others returned to the Continent.

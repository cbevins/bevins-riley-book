As the climate of Britain gradually warmed from the Last Ice Age some 12,000 years ago,
the receding glaciers were followed by modern <Em>Homo sapiens</Em> from Europe and Asia.
England was still connected to modern day France by a land bridge called the
<Enquote>Doggerland</Enquote>,
which became submerged by rising sea levels about 6,200 years ago. Thus human
migration from Europe to Great Britain initially did not require any water crossing.
DNA studies show this first wave of humans came primarily from early farming
communities in Anatolia (central Turkey), and a Neolithic (stone age) farming and
livestock culture was well establish in Britain by 4,000 BP.

The beginning of the <Bold>Bronze Age</Bold> (2500-800 BC) created a large population
turnover, with more than 90% of Britainâ€™s Neolithic ancestry displaced.
DNA studies indicate these new people came from the Asian Steppes and areas
associated with the spread of Indo-European languages.
Bronze Age culture used copper and bronze to fashion tools, weapons, and jewelry.
It is this culture that is primarily responsible for the megalithic monuments of
Avebury, Stonehenge, Silbury Hill, and Must Farm.
The Celtic language may have started developing around this time as well.

Iron working techniques found their way to Britain about 750 BC, marking the start
of the <Bold>Iron Age</Bold>. Iron revolutionized farming and agriculture with
the introduction of iron-tipped ploughs and axes for clearing land.
Common Brythonic became a widely spoken language, and Celtic and Welsh place
names first appear.  As populations increased, wars broke out between opposing
tribes leading to the development of many hill forts throughout Britain;
some 3,300 locations are known today.

Pytheas of Massalia, the Greek geographer, navigator, and explorer, circumnavigated
and visited Britain about 325 BC.  He reported that the Britons were renown wheat
farmers.  As the Roman Empire began to expand (200 - 50 BC), many Celtic speaking
peoples from Gaul (France and Belgium) were driven north and sought refuge in the
south of Britain.

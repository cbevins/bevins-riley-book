The Romans had already been harried for decades by the Picts (Painted Ones)
of Scotland, the Scoti of Ireland, and the Saxons from modern day Denmark.
With the Roman exit, the local Romano-Britons tribes were quickly overrun by Germanic
tribes from the Continent who came to settle and farm.  There were numerous
incursions by pagan <Bold>Anglos</Bold>, <Bold>Saxons</Bold>, and <Bold>Jutes</Bold>
(all from modern day Denmark), and <Bold>Frisians</Bold> (from northern Netherlands).
They swept over all of England, establishing their Seven Kingdoms,
or <Enquote>Heptarchy</Enquote> by about 450 AD.
This is the time when King Arthur, if he existed, would have lived and fought.

The culture of Britain became distinctly ‘Anglo-Saxon’, the people became known
as ‘Anglich’ or ‘Englisc’, and the West Germanic dialect called <Bold>Old English</Bold>
(aka ‘Anglo-Saxon’) became the dominant language, replacing the Celtic Common Brittonic.
Old English is largely incomprehensible for modern English speakers without study.

In 2022 a genetic study using modern and ancient DNA samples from England was
conducted to examine the biological effects of Anglo-Saxon migration.  They concluded these
immigrants came from an area stretching from the northern Netherlands through

in the 5th century.  The authors broadly estimate the modern English ancestry to be
about 25-47% 'north continental', 11-57% British Iron Age peoples, and 14-43%
from modern day France and Belgium.

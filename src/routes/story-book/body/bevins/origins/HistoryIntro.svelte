Most Americans know very little about the history of England beyond the legend of
King Arthur, for whom their is no historical evidence.
Yet England has a long, complicated, rich, and varied history that directly
defines what it means to be 'English' and influenced our English ancestors'
lives and reasons for emigrating.

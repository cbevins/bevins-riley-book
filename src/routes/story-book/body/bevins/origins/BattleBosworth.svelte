New Verdon was an agricultural center until 1850's, when coal mining became predominant.

In the itinerary of 1280, Newbold, Brascote, Naneby and Barlestone answered collectively
as one village, which contained 80 acres of woodland and a vineyard.

A part of Newbold was enclosed in 1509, although the main enclosure took place in 1810
when the church was awarded 1,316 acres of glebe land
(used to support the parish priest and any other church endeavors).

    </div>  
    The Battle of Bosworth (or Bosworth Field) was fought on 22 Aug 1485
    between the reigning King Richard III of the House of York,
    and an alliance of Lancastrians and Yorkist led by Henry Tudor.
    This last significant battle of the War of the Roses was first met
    on Ambion Hill just south of Market Bosworth.
    Richard was killed in this battle, ending the Plantagenet dynasty
    and ushering in the Tudor dynasty, making it one of the defining
    events of English history.
    This moment was enshrined at the end of William Shakespeareâ€™s play Richard III.

    Framework knitters were operating in the village in 1812, and by 1845 over 60 frames were in existence. By then, coal was being mined in the neighboring villages and many abandoned their frames and drifted into the mines.

    Like many other villages Newbold was almost self supporting having its own tailors, blacksmith and wheelwright, butchers and shoemakers.

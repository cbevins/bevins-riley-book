The origins of grandfather <Name>Samuel Bevins</Name>'s mother's
<Name ggp='1' life='1848-1922'>Mary Ann White</Name> is more of a puzzle.
We know the following about her from source documents:

<ul class="mt-2 list-inside list-disc">
<li class='py-1'>
1843: <Name ggp='2' life='1843-1935'>William Alfred Bevins</Name> is born in
<Place>Leicester, Leicetsreshire, England.</Place>
</li><li class='py-1'>
1845: <Name ggp='2' life='1843-1935'>William Alfred Bevins</Name> emmigrates
to American at age 2.
</li><li class='py-1'>
1848: <Name>Mary Ann White</Name> is born in Torquey, Devon, England.
</li><li class='py-1'>
April 1869: <Name>Mary Ann</Name> is married in Plymouth, Devon, England,
but we don't know the name of the groom.
</li><li class='py-1'>
1870: <Name>Mary Ann</Name> gives birth to daughter
<Name life='1870-1937'>Mary Allace Bevins</Name>
in <Place>Leicester, Leicestershire, England</Place>.
</li><li class='py-1'>
1871 <Source>1910 USFC</Source> or 1873 <Source>1900 USFC</Source>:
<Name>Mary Ann</Name> and daughter <Name>Mary Allace</Name> arrive in America
after the Civil War. (I have not been able to find their names on any
immigration documents or passenger lists to indicate their arrival port
or if they were traveling alone or with an adult male.
But daughter <Name>Mary Allace</Name>'s obituary states
<Enquote>She came to Illinois with her father at the age of one</Enquote>, and
<Enquote>Sam Bevans, Deer River</Enquote> is listed as a surviving brother.)
</li><li class='py-1'>
1874: <Name>Mary Ann Bevins</Name> marries
<Name ggp='2'>William Alfred Bevins</Name> in Annawan, Henry County, Illinois.
</li><li class='py-1'>
1880: The 1880 USFC lists the <Name>Bevins-White</Name> household with children
Allace (10), Simon (5), Elisabeth (4), Nellie (2), and Feebee (1/12).
</li>
</ul>
</P><P>
Following is one possible scenario that would agree with the above facts:
</P><P><Italic>
<Name>Mary Ann White</Name> married into the <Name>Bevins</Name> family in 1869
and takes on the family surname.
The couple moved to the <Name>Bevins</Name> home county of Leicestershire
where she gave bith to daughter <Name>Mary Allace</Name> in 1870.
In 1871 the family emmigrated to America where many other <Name>Bevins</Name>
family members had previously settled.
The unknown husband/father died enroute or after arrival.
As was so commonplace in those times, out of necessity of survival,
the 23 year old widow and mother marries the 31 year old 
<Name ggp='2'>William Alfred Bevins</Name> who lives nearby in the community.
The couple go on to have 4 children by the 1880 USFC,
and <Name>Samuel Bevins</Name> 2 years later.

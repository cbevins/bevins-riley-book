While Julius Caesar was burnishing his reputation by raping and pillaging France
in his Gallic Wars campaign, he made a brief reconnaissance into Britain with two
legions in 55 BC.
He returned the next year with 5 legions, 800 ships, and 2000 cavalry, forcing
the overwhelmed local chieftains to pay tribute to Rome.

Emperor Claudius invaded again in 40 BC and established a 400 year occupation.
The next several decades were spent expanding northwards into modern day Scotland.
In 122 AD, Emperor Hadrian recalled all Roman troops scattered across Scotland
back to a more defensible frontier line and constructed <Bold>Hadrianâ€™s Wall</Bold>
near the present day English-Scottish border.  Over the next 250 years the Romans made
multiple attempts to subdue Scotland, but to no avail.

When the Romans conquered Britannia they brought their culture with them,
including civil engineering, road building, villas, bath houses, as well
as <Em>wine, wine making, and viticulture</Em>.  Until then, the poor Britons had only
their mead and ale as an alternative to drinking the unsanitary waters of early habitation.

    As an amusing historical aside; in 209 AD the Romans again invaded Scotland,
    this time under the generalship of Emperor Severus. During negotiations with
    the opposing Britonic-Pictish coalition, Severus' wife Julia Domna criticized the
    sexual morals of the Caledonian women. The wife of the Caledonia chief replied:
    <Enquote>We consort openly with the best of men while you allow yourselves to be
    debauched in private by the worst</Enquote>. This is the first recorded utterance
    confidently attributable to a native of the area now known as Scotland.

In AD 324 Constantine the Great became the sole ruler of Rome. A Christian convert,
he moved the seat of the Roman Empire to Constantinople in Turkey.  This split the
empire into an Eastern Roman Empire with an Eastern Orthodox church
and a Western Roman Empire with a Roman Catholic church, and left Rome as a
weakened backwater.  The power vacuum was quickly challenged both by Teutonic tribes
from the north of the Rhine boundary and Roman usurpers commanding legions in
Britannia and Gaul.
</P><P>
Finally, in 407 AD the usurper Constantine III took the remaining Roman legions
out of Britain to confront the Alans, Vandals, and Seubi tribes
who had crossed the Rhine boundary into Gaul
and the Visigoths who were invading south from the Alps.
Not only was Britain was no longer under Roman control or protection,
but the Visigoths sacked Rome in 407.

While Julius Caesar was burnishing his reputation by raping and pillaging France
in his Gallic Wars campaign, he made a brief reconnaissance into Britain with two
legions in 55 BC.
He returned the next year with 5 legions, 800 ships, and 2000 cavalry, forcing
the overwhelmed local chieftains to pay tribute to Rome.

Emperor Claudius invaded again in 40 BC and established a 400 year occupation.
The next several decades were spent expanding northwards into modern day Scotland.
In 122 AD, Emperor Hadrian recalled all Roman troops scattered across Scotland
back to a more defensible frontier line and constructed <Bold>Hadrianâ€™s Wall</Bold>
near the present day English-Scottish border.  Over the next 250 years the Romans made
multiple attempts to subdue Scotland, but to no avail.

When the Romans conquered Britannia they brought their culture with them,
including civil engineering, road building, villas, bath houses, as well
as <Em>wine, wine making, and viticulture</Em>.  Until then, the poor Britons had only
their mead and ale as an alternative to drinking the unsanitary waters of early habitation.

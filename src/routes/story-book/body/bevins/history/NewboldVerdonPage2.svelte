The itinerary of 1280 lists Newbold and nearby Brascote, Naneby, and Barlestone
as one village, with 80 acres of woodland <Em>and a vineyard</Em>.
The manor was held in 1401 by Walter Devereux, and later Henry de Ferrars.

A part of Newbold Verdon was enclosed in 1509, although the main enclosure took
place in 1810 when the church was awarded 1316 acres of glebe land.
Enclosures were made by manor lords (and increasing numbers of private landowners)
to convert open-field shared commons tenant farms to the more lucrative sheep
and wool industry. This displaced many tenant serfs from land worked by their
families for centuries, and created vagrancy and economic problems throughout
England.

By the start of the <Em>British Industrial Revolution</Em> (1760-1840),
agriculture became much more efficient, peasant farmland was being removed by enclosures,

fewer people were required to work the fields, and large farm families were
increasing the rural population.  Young men and women had fewer opportunities
to work as farmers, and more were working in woolen or cotton mills,
often moving to urban centers to do so.

In Newbold Verdon, framework knitters were operating in 1812, and by 1845 over
60 frames were in existence.  Also at this time, coal was being mined in over
a dozen locations in neighboring villages.

Those not wishing to work the factories, mills, and mines to keep on farming
in a rural environment had fewer and fewer options, and began looking to America
where land was still plentiful and cheap.
This is the situation <Name>William Alfred Bevins</Name> and his new wife
<Name>Mary Bolt</Name> found themselves in 1845, when they chose to emigrate to America, 			.

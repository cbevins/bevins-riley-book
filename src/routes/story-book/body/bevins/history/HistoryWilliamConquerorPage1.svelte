In 1066, William, Duke of Normandy in northern France, invaded England and
defeated Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings, fundamentally changing
the course of English history.
</P><P>
William was a Norman (aka <Em>Norseman</Em>), a descendant of a Viking king
who became the first ruler of Normandy in 911.  Born in 1028, it took William
30 years to fully consolidate his claim to power in Normandy and neighboring Maine.
When the English King Edward the Confessor died in January 1066, William, now an
accomplished commander, decided to press his claim of right to the English throne.
</P><P>
Once William won his initial battle over his rival, he marched upon and captured
London and was crowned King on Christmas Day 1066.  But it would take him another
18 years of nearly constant campaigning to subdue the many sectors of England,
put down multiple revolts by his earls, and repulse further raids from Denmark
and Ireland.
</P><P>
The effects of William's conquest are far reaching, reforming the English
political system, language, culture, and system of land tenure:
</P><P>
<Rarrow/> William forced the consolidation of all England south of Scotland
under his single rule and moved the capital from Winchester to London.
</P><P>
<Rarrow/> Old French (Norman French) became the language of the palaces, courts, churches,
schools, administrative offices, manor houses, and upper society.

<Rarrow/> Wine became the beverage of choice of the upper class.
</P><P>
<Rarrow/> Englandâ€™s relationship with France was strengthened, while its previous historical
ties with Scandanavia were diminished.
</P><P>
<Rarrow/> The earliest hereditary surnames in England are found shortly after the
Norman invasion and are of Norman French origin rather than native English.
</P><P>
<Rarrow/> In 1085 William commissioned a survey and valuation of all landholding throughout
his kingdom organized by shire (county).  The resulting <Bold>Domesday Book</Bold>
is an invaluable primary source for modern historians and economists, listing
13,418 place names, 5,624 flour mills, and <Em>42 vineyards</Em>.
Nothing of similar scope was attempted again in Britain for 790 years.

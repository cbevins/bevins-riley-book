with a population of 39.

In the Iron Age, Roman and the Sub-Roman periods, Devon was the home of the
<Bold>Dumnonii Celtic Britons</Bold>.
The first evidence of settlement dates back to the Saxon period.
The Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain resulted in the partial assimilation of
Dumnonia into the kingdom of <Bold>Wessex</Bold> in the eighth and ninth centuries.
</P><P>
Much of Brixham was built in Victorian times. It was known as the “great fishery
of the west,” because Brixham fishermen developed the technique of trawling in the 1760's.
Nearby is Windmill Hill Cave, occupied from prehistoric until Roman times.
Population in 2021 was 16,825.

Historically Brixham was made up of two separate communities connected only by a
marshy lane. In <Bold>Fishtown</Bold>, in the immediate vicinity of the harbour,
the residents made a living mainly from fishing and related trades while one mile
inland is <Bold>Cowtown</Bold> which made its living from agriculture.
</P><P>
In the middle of the 1850's the town still boasted the largest fishing fleet in England,
with over 250 boats keeping well over 1,000 fishermen employed.
Other maritime trades such as sail, rope and net-making were needed as well
and became a conspicuous feature of the Brixham townscape,
forming an important part of the local economy in their own right.

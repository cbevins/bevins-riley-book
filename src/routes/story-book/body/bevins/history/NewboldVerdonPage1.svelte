In 2011 Newbold Verdon had a population of 3000 and neighboring <Bold>Market Bosworth</Bold>,
a village 2.5 miles to the west, had a population of 2100.  Both are within
Leicestershire county, just 10 miles from its boundary with Derbyshire.
Both counties are generally low-lying farmlands characterized by small, rolling hills.
</P><P>
No location in England is more than 70 miles from the sea; Newbold Verdon
is about as landlocked as possible at 65 miles distant. The geographic center
of England is 5 miles southwest of Market Bosworth.
</P><P>
Evidence of settlement here dates back to the <Em>Bronze Age</Em>,
and the region contains Roman settlements and villas.  The area was settled by the
Anglos in the 6th century when it became a part of the <Em>Kingdom of Mercia</Em>.
In 873 AD the <Em>Great Viking Army</Em> overwintered at Repton some 10 miles to
the northwest. Both villages are enumerated in the <Em>Domesday Book</Em> of 1086.

William the Conqueror awarded the village Bosworth as a manor to the Count of Meulan
from Normandy, Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester. The village then passed
by marriage to the English branch of the French House of Harcourt.
In 1285 King Edward I granted a royal charter for a Wednesday market in Bosworth village,
officially making Market Bosworth a full fledged ‘town’.
</P><P>
In 1485 the <Bold>Battle of Bosworth</Bold> took place a few miles south of the towns.
This was the last significant battle of the <Em>War of the Roses</Em> (1455-1487)
between the House of Lancaster and the House of York.
The Lancastrian King Richard III was killed at this battle, leaving the Tudor family
(Henry VII through Elizabeth I) to inherit their claim to the throne for
the next 118 years and making it one of the defining events of English history.
This moment was enshrined at the end of William Shakespeare’s play
<Em>Richard III</Em>.

This chapter is devoted to the direct ancestors of our grandmother

To date I have found 122 direct ancestors of <Name sup='gp'>Hattie Jane Collins</Name>
going back 14 generations, with the earliest recorded births for
<Name ggp='12' life='1560-1595'>Bishop Christopher 'William' Overton</Name>
of Yorkshire, England, and
<Name ggp='12' life='1565-1644'>James Isaac Speer</Name> of Renfrewshire, Scotland.
</P><P>
The overwhelming number of ancestors were born in America and England,
with about a dozen in Scotland, 6 in Ireland, 2 in Germany, and 1 in France.

The earliest direct ancestor of Collins' descent was
<Name ggp='7' life='1615-1714'>Elizabeth Kinsey</Name> born in Maryland
five years before the Pilgrims arrived at Plymouth Rock
and 7 years after the founding of Jamestown, VA.
In fact, she is the earlist American-born of our direct ancestors.

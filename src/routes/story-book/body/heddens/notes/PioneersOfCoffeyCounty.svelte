<Italic>Pioneers of Coffee County</Italic> as told by J.P. Hamilton Sr, as
publish in The LeRoy Reporter. He begins on page 119:
<Enquote>The first day of April, 1857, I found myself and my wife
boarding a train at Findely, Ohio, bound for "Bleeding Kansas" and John Heddens house.

He then details his trip by train, boat, and ox cart. On page 125:
<Enquote>
On the west side of the river I found the Heddenses who moved into the territory in 1855.
The father died in February prior to my arrival, leaving the widow, four sons,
and one daughter, John, Levi, James, Noah, and Ann. The latter was styled the bell of
the Neosho; their uncle, Noah Vandever and his family, consisting of his wife, himself,
and four children - Charles, William, John, and Jane.

So the above pertains to our 4th GGF James Heddens, who was was born in 1800 in
Pennsylvania, and died in 1855 in Burlington, Coffey Co., and was married to
Martha Vandever. Our 3rd GGF John Heddens was their eldest son, born in 1828 in
Preble Co, Ohio. Levi was also born in Ohio in 1830, James in 1837 in Indiana,
Noah in 1840 in Indiana, and Angeline (Ann) born in 1843 in Indiana.

Our 3rd GGP John Heddens and Mary Margaret Krider were married in 1852 in Indiana,
and moved with his parents to Kansas in 1855.  They gave birth to our 2ndGGP
George Custer Heddens in Coffey, Kansas in 1857, probably one of the first
pioneer births in Kansas.

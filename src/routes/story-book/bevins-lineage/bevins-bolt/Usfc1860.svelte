    <ul class='list-disc list-inside'>
        <li>Since Samuel, age 5, was born in Ohio, and Julia, age 3, was born in Illinois,
            the family must have moved to Annawan circa 1855 - 1857.</li>
        <li>
            Daughter Mary, who was age 1 in 1850, is no longer listed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Five of their 7 neighboring farming families listed on this census sheet
            were also born in England, and all had property valued at $1600-$1800 and personal estate of $450-$550.
        </li>
        <li>
            The third dwelling listed before their's was occupied by a 'James Bevins', age 28, born in England,
            his wife 'Mary J Bevins', born in NY, and daughters Julia (5) and Martha (1).
            I do not know what relationship, if any, the two families had.
